This is likely the result of unzipping an archive directly inside the /opt/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone/deployments directory, which is a user error. The META-INF directory will not be scanned for deployments, but it is possible that the scanner mayfind other files from the unzipped archive and attempt to deploy them, leading to errors.
